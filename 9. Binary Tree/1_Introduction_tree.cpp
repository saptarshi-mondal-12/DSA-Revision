Binary Tree: 
Binary tree is a fundamental hierarchical data structure in computer science that comprises nodes arranged in a tree-like structure. It consists of nodes, where each node can have at most two children nodes, known as the left child and the right child.

Nodes: 
Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data, often referred to as the nodeâ€™s value or key. This node also contains references and pointers to its left and right children so that we can traverse from one node to another in a hierarchical order.

Root Node: 
it is the topmost node of a binary tree from which all other nodes stem out. This serves as the entry point for traversing the tree structure.

Children Nodes: 
are the nodes directly connected to a parent node. In a binary tree, a parent node can have zero, one or two children nodes, each situated to the left or right of the parent node.

Leaf Nodes:
are the nodes that do not have any children. These nodes lie on the outermost ends of the tree branches and are the terminal points of the traversal.

Ancestors:
in a Binary Tree are those nodes that lie on the path from a particular node to the root node. They are the nodes encountered while moving upwards from a specific node through its parent nodes until reaching the root of the tree.
